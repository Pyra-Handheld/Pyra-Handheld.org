### Powerful CPU

With a dual-core ARM Cortex-A15, the Pyra has a state-of-the-art mobile CPU.

It is fast enough to compile stuff on-the-go or work fluently with applications like LibreOffice, Gimp or Firefox.
It will also be able to emulate any game console up to the PlayStation 1, Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast and any handheld up to the DS and PSP in fullspeed.

During the development phase, we'll release videos in the blog showing how fast it is.

### Great battery life

One of the greatest things of the Pandora was the awesome battery life.

We will try to achieve that with the Pyra as well!

It's too early yet to make estimations, but in theory the Pyra should use less battery for the same CPU power compared to the Pandora, but it will need more battery for CPU intense tasks.

The Pyra will use the same batteries as the Pandora, which is great for Pandora owners.

### Physical controls

For serious gamers, great gaming controls are a very important part of any gaming console.

Except for the analog nubs, the Pandora had excellent gaming controls!

The nubs on the Pyra will be improved, while we're also trying to keep the remaining controls as good as they were.

On popular demand, we'll have four shoulder buttons and most likely also six face-buttons.

### Full HD screen

1920x1080 pixel is A LOT for a 5" screen. Besides smooth fonts on your desktop, high-res pictures look incredible on it.

We can also imagine that it can be used to improve the feel of emulating classic consoles with specific filters (CRT effects like bloom, scanlines, etc.)

For gaming, the response time is also very important. That's why we chose one with a fast response time to prevent ghosting - another small issue the Pandora had.

### Audiophile sound

The Pandora had high quality audio out, better than most MP3 players out there.

This is something we want to keep in the Pyra as well - so you can connect it to your HiFi and enjoy music in great quality.

### Dual SDXC slots

The Pyra features two full-size Dual SDXC Slots - one of them will be able to boot from SD Card.

Install your favourite OS on your SD Card or simply use it for hundreds of Gigabyte for storage.

It's a great and easy way to increase the storage of the Pyra and make it future-proof.

### Connectivity

Mobile devices often lack standard ports that you can find on a normal PC.

As the Pyra IS basically a pocket PC, we want to implement as many standards as possible.

Besides Wifi, Bluetooth and optional 3G/UMTS/GPS, it features all sizes of USB Ports (Full size, Micro USB and Mini USB) as well as a MicroHDMI and a headset port.

This makes it possible to use almost any standard USB device on the Pyra.

### Touchscreen

Of course with that kind of pixel density, you need a touch screen with a precision that matches the resolution.

Unlike most smartphones, the Pyra has a resistive touch screen, which offers great accuracy and can be used with both fingers and a standard stylus.

It can also do a fake multi-touch so you can use it for gestures like pinch-to-zoom or rotate.
